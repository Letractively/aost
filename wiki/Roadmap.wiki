  * Add support for TestNG (Done)
  * Enhance Data Driven Testing to add data readers for XML files, CSV format files, and database.

  * Move the test cases for Tellurium project web site out of the trunk and create a new reference project that will only use tellurium jar. This reference will be an example to demonstrate how to use Tellurium.
