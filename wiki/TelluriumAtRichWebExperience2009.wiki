[http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/orlando/2009/12/home The Rich Web Experience 2009] was held on December 1-4 in Orlando, FL. Luckily, we got in as [http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/orlando/2009/12/schedule a rapid fire session] from 7:45PM-8:30PM on December 2nd. Even though Tellurium was covered by [http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/new_orleans/2009/10/speakers/paul_king Paul King], co-author of "Groovy in Action", at [http://www.slideshare.net/paulk_asert/groovy-testing-aug2009-1945995 Agile 2009], it was the first public presentation by our Tellurium team. We were very excited by it. 

Vivek and I drove for 10 hours on December 1st to get Orlando, FL from Knoxville, TN and was very exhausted that night. On the second day, we went to the reception desk to get our badges. After the breakfast, we started to attend sessions. I attended Brian Sletten's two sessions on REST and RDFA in the morning, and Dylan Schiemann's Dojo Toolkit in the afternoon. They were all very good presentations. 

After the BIRDS OF A FEATHER SESSION and dinner, Vivek and I started to prepare for the presentation. We first had some problem with the screen resolution for the projector, but soon we resolved. I brought in a digital camera, but it was a pretty old one still with cassette. I had really a hard time to find a right place to put it since the organizer did not provide any recording service. I put it on a third row chair, but Dylan Schiemann came and sat on the second row, we would record part of his shoulder, thus, I had to move the camera to another chair in a hurry.

We thought there might be only couple people in our session after the long day. Even I felt tired somehow. Surprisingly,  actually there were 15-20 people in our session. Overall, the session was good. Our demos run smoothly.
