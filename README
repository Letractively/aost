The Tellurium Automated Testing Framework (Tellurium), formally known as abstract object based Selenium Test framework (AOST), is a test framework built on
top of the Selenium test framework and it abstracts UI components to Java objects and does object to locator mapping (OLM) automatically at run time so that
you can define UI objects simply by their attributes and write your selenium tests just like writing Java tests. Since the framework constructs the actual
locator automatically at run-time and it uses the Group Locating Concept (GLC) to exploit information inside a collection of UI components to help finding
their locators, AOST is more robust, flexible, modularized, easier to maintain and refactor compared with the locator-based Selenium test framework.

The Tellurium framework defines a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for object-oriented Selenium test. You can even write your selenium tests in pure DSL format.

The Tellurium framework is basically written in Groovy, but the test cases can be written in Java and you do not need to know Groovy before you use it. Detailed
introudction, Frequent Asked Questions, and illustrative examples are provided.

Your feedback and comments are very important to us. Please post your comments and suggestions on Tellurium user group or write directly to us.

Thanks.
