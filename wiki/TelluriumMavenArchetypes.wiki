== How Tellurium Maven Archetypes Are Created ==

Tellurium includes two maven archetypes, i.e., tellurium-junit-archetype and tellurium-testng-archetype for Tellurium JUnit test project and Tellurium TestNG test project, respectively.

The procedures to create tellurium Maven archetypes are surprisingly simple. Take the tellurium-junit-archetype as an example.

First, create a maven archetype project using the following maven command

{{{
mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=tellurium -DartifactId=tellurium-junit-archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-archetype
}}} 

Then, you need to copy the prototype files to the archetype directory: {{{src/main/resources/archetype-resources/}}}, including pom file, example UI module file, and example Tellurium JUnit test file.

After that, you need to customize the archetype descriptor, archetype.xml in directory: {{{src/main/resources/META-INF/}}}. Notice that GMaven uses {{{src/main/groovy}}} and {{{src/test/groovy}}} directories and you must put them under the resources tag.

The last step is to build and deploy the archetype using the following command

{{{
mvn package deploy
}}}

Sometimes, you may like to first try to test it on your local repository, then you can 
run 

{{{
mvn install
}}}

To create a test project from the local repository, you should use the offline option "-o".
