= Introduction =

Tellurium leverage jQuery to add [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/TelluriumjQuerySelector jQuery selector] as a new locator to improve the test speed in IE and add other new functionalities to Selenium core, for example, fetching bulk data in one method call and [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/TelluriumPowerUtilityDiagnose the diagonse utility].

With the adoption of jQuery, we also need some custom jQuery selectors and functions to meet our needs.

To design jQuery custom selectors, we need to understand the jQuery selector syntax:

{{{
$.expr[':'].selector_name = function(obj, index, meta, stack){
}}}

where
  * _obj_: a current DOM element
  * _index_: the current loop index in stack
  * _meta_: meta data about your selector
  * _stack_: stack of all elements to loop

The function returns true to include current element and returns false to explude current element. A more detailed explains could be found on [http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/06/jquery-custom-selectors-with-parameters.html jQuery Custom Selectors with Parameters].
