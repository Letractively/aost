#summary Tellurium First Anniversary: Retrospect And Prospect.

= Introduction =

The Tellurium Automated Testing Framework (Tellurium) is one year old now if we count from the day that it becomes an open source project. Tellurium was originated from a small project I did for my company, i.e, use Selenium to test one application written in the Dojo Javascript Framework. That was in 2007 and Selenium became popular in that time. Selenium was a ground-breaking framework at that time since it offered of unique features such as creating test scripts using Selenium IDE and then replaying it. It was very attractive to a lot of people including me, which was why I took over the task in our Scrum team. 

Soon, I realized the task was not easy at all because the application was too dynamic to simply use the "record and play" mode. The first thought was to refactor the Selenium IDE generated code to make generalize it. But later, this proved to be as difficult as to re-generate a new test code. To be honest, I was not a web developer and my work mainly focused on the server side of Enterprise applications with a lot of research background in the past. I think my background helped to see problem more clearly. I was hit by the idea: "Why not define the UI objects first and make them robust to changes". 

Many Selenium users like me may also notice that Selenium code is verbose and the XPath locator is everywhere. For maintenance purpose, it is preferable to have structured test code, which led to the UI module concept.
