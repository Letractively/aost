== Issues ==
 * Unable to start selenium server due to conflicted port
   >> Change port number from 4444 to 4445 for both port setings from embeddedserver and connector setting in the TelluriumConfig.groovy file
 * Firefox version 3.0.1 does not work properly and hang during running a testcase
   >>  This is a known Selenium issue. A work-around is to install the 2.0.16 firefox version or change browser type to use iehta. You can make this change in TelluriumConfig.groovy file located at the Tellirium root project folder.
