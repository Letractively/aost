== How to use Tellurium ==

There are two ways to use Tellurium. The first one is first write your UI modules
in different Groovy files, which extends the DslContext class. Then write 
JUnit test cases. You can also include them in a test suite. 

Starting from Tellurium 0.4.0, JUnit 4.4 is supported. Usually, users only need to extend TelluriumJavaTestCase to write Tellurium Tests. The TelluriumJavaTestCase has already included the setUp and tearDown methods in class level using JUnit 4 @BeforeClass and
@AfterClass annotations. If users want to include multiple test cases in one test suite, they should use BaseTelluriumJavaTestCase so that all the test cases can share the same Selenium connection. If users really want to write Tellurium tests in groovy, please use TelluriumGroovyTestCase and TelluriumSuiteGroovyTestCase instead.

The other way is to write DSL script directly, which is recommended only for non-developers since you cannot create different modules if write in pure DSL. 
The DslScriptExecutor can be used to run the .dsl files.

== Examples ==

In this tutorial, the following examples are provided:

  # [http://http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/BasicExample Basic Examples], which include Google Start Page, Google Code Hosting Page, and Google Book List Page.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/AdvancedExample Advanced Examples], which use the Tellurium project website as a reference to guide you how to write non-trivial and more complicated Tellurium Tests.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/DataDrivenTestingExample Data Driven Testing Examples], which illustrate how to write Tellurium Data Driven Tests and elaborate on the input, testing engine, and output.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/DSLExample DSL Examples]. DSL is another way to write Tellurium tests. The examples include regular Tellurium tests and Tellurium Data Driven tests Written in pure DSL.
