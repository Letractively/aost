= FAQs for Tellurium =

=== Q1: Why do you create the Tellurium framework ===
More than one year ago, two colleagues in my company went to a conference and came back talking about the Selenium test framework, which seems very attractive at the first sight. But soon, we realized that it is very difficult to maintain and refactor, which is often the case in an agile environment. I worked on the selenium tests for a project and came out with the idea of using abstract object modules to add another tier to the selenium framework. The framework was written in Java and later on, couple colleagues from other teams tried to use my framework, but it was quite difficult to use because it lacks of expressiveness. Recently, I re-write my framework using Groovy to make it much easier to use and add a lot of functionalities which are difficult to implement without the dynamic nature of Groovy. I make it open source so that more people can use it and I can improve it with your suggestions and comments.

=== Q2: Who Tellurium is developed for ===
Tellurium is developed for anyone who needs to write selenium tests, including developers, QA people, or any one who knows about XPATH or HTML markup. Tellurium includes a DSL executor. You can write your test in pure DSL, but by writing Java test cases you have the advantage to modularize you code.

=== Q3: How do I use the Tellurium framework ===
The Tellurium framework is mainly written in Groovy and the code can be compiled as a jar file. You can include the Jar file in your lib directory and write your JUnit tests by extending TelluriumJavaTestCase if you want all your test code in one Java class or by extends BaseTelluriumJavaTestCase if your test codes are in multiple test files and you want to put them in a test suite. 

The second way is to write Tellurium tests in groovy, users can use TelluriumGroovyTestCase for a single test and TelluriumSuiteGroovyTestCase for a test suite.

The other way is to write DSL script directly, that is to say, your tests will be pure DSL scripts. This is really good for non-developers or QA people. The DslScriptExecutor? can be used to run the .dsl files.

Tellurium comes with an embedded Selenium server and you do not need to set up an external selenium server. You can still use external selenium server by changing the settings in the configuration file, TelluriumConfig.groovy.
  
=== Q4:  How to run the Tellurium tests ===
If your tests are written in Java, you just run them like JUnit test cases or test suites. If your test code is written in pure dsl, please use "DslScriptExecutor dsl_file" to run it.

=== Q5:  How do I get the XPath of a UI object ===
There are a lot of ways, such as Selenium IDE. For firefox, the best way is to use the XPather plugin, which supports showing xpath by clicking on WEB. You may need to refactor the xpath a bit to make it simpler and more robust. Another good plugin for Firefox is web developer, which allows you to look at the DOM at run time.

Tellurium is tested under Firefox and it should support other browsers since it is built on top of the selenium framework. 

=== Q6: Do I need to write a class for every page? ===
Not really, as long as the locators you specified are correct at run time, you can define UI objects from different pages in one class, which is fine for pure DSL. But for Java test cases, I would suggest you write multiple UI modules for a page as a class to make it easier to maintain and refactor. 

=== Q7: Does Tellurium only focus on unit testing? ===
Selenium test itself is kind of functional test or integration test. Although Tellurium uses JUnit test, it is still functional test or integration test. You can put a lot of test cases into a test suite and the test suite can be your UAT test. Furthermore, you can also create data-driven tests using TelluriumDataDrivenTest.

=== Q8: Currently I am creating test cases using selenium-IDE, If I change my work to Tellurium, can I get my work simpler and much easier? ===
Sure, Tellurium has a lot of pre-defined UI Objects, which will handle all the actions and data automatically for you. For example, you can define a template for a table element, the framework will automatically help you to locate the table[i][j] element and support the different actions for them. 

=== Q9: What is the object to locator mapping (OLM) framework you talked about ===
The object to locator mapping (OLM) framework is available from version 0.3.0. It includes couple parts. The first one is to map a UI id in the format of "search1.inputbox1" to the actual object you defined in your object module. The second part will be automatically mapping a certain parameters you provided for a UI to its actual locator. For example, you can say the UI object has the tag "input" and other attributes. Tellurium will try to create the XPath for you to make your life easier. The third will be to utilize the group object concept to locate the UI module in the DOM at run time. 

=== Q10: What IDE should I use for Tellurium ===
Since Tellurium requires Groovy support, you can use Eclipse, Netbeans, or IntelliJ with groovy plugin if you want to work on Tellurium source code. IntelliJ is recommended because its Groovy plugin is excellent. If you only need to use Tellurium as a jar file, you can use any IDE that supports JAVA.

=== Q11: Why I cannot start selenium test ===
Make sure your web browser in your environment path. If you cannot really make it work, check the settings for the embedded server section in the configuration file TelluriumConfig.groovy. Or change the file SeleniumConnector.groovy, although this is not really recommended. Change the following line:
{{{
sel = new DefaultSelenium("localhost", port, "*chrome", baseURL);
}}}

=== Q12: How do I add my own UI object to Tellurium ===
First, you need to create your UI object groovy class by extending class UiObject or Container if it is a container type object. Then, you need to create your UI object builder by extending class UiObjectBuilder. Finally, register your ui builder for your ui object by call the 
{{{
public void registerBuilder(String uiObjectName, UiObjectBuilder builder)
}}}
method in class TelluriumFramework. You can also register your builder in class UiObjectBuilderRegistry if you work on Tellurium source code directly.

=== Q13: How to build Tellurium from source ===
Tellurium provides the ant build script. You may need to change some of the settings in the build.properties file so that it matches your environment. For example, the settings for javahome and javac.compiler. Then in the project root directory, run command: 

{{{
ant clean
}}}
to clean up old build and run
{{{
ant dist
}}}
to generate a new artifact, which can be found in the dist directory.

Run 
{{{
ant compile-test
}}}
to compile test code.

=== Q14: How to use composite locator ===
To use composite locator, you need to use "clocator" and its value is a map, i.e., [key1: value1, key2: value2, ...] format in Groovy. The defined keys include "header", "tag", "text", "trailer", and "position". They are all optional. If a UI object has fixed tag and it is defined in object class, you do not need to include "tag". 

You may have additional attributes, define them in the same way as the predefined keys. For example {{{[value: "Tellurium home"]}}}

=== Q15: How to use group locating ===
First make sure the UI object is a Container or other classe that extends Container. You can specify {{{group: "true"}}}, which will turn on group locating. That is the only thing you need to do. The group locating will be done by Tellurium automatically at run time. Right now, the UI object can only use the information provided in its child's composite locator. Other children with base locators will be ignored.  

I suggest you only use the group locating option at the top level object. Once the top level object is found, it is not a big deal to find its descendants. 

=== Q16: Why do you use a programming language to define GUI mapping, not simply use a plain and flat properties file ===
I used that way to write selenium tests for a whole project one year ago and I know how painful that is. There are drawbacks to use properties file because you have to specifiy the runtime locators, which is painful for developers and may not be robust unless you are xpath expert. The Tellurium framework can utilize relationship between UI objects to automatically generate the runtime xpath for you. Also It exploits the Group Locating concept to co-locate a group of UI objects. In the future, more advanced features and tools will be developed so that developers do not need to manually find the locators for UI elements. They can simply map their JSP or other mark-up files to the Tellurium UI definition or use tools to automatically do that.

=== Q17: Is your basic DSL really a DSL ? ===
The DSL is in the domain of "Selenium Test" and it is a DSL. 

=== Q18: DO I need to know Groovy before I write Tellurium test cases ===
Not really. If you write your test as pure DSL, you only need to know the DSL syntax. If you need to write your test in Java, you only need to define your UI modules in Groovy file by extending the DslContext class. Since Groovy accept all Java syntax, you can in fact write Java code in your Groovy file that defines the UI modules. For the actual TestCase or TestSuite, they are already Java code. As long as you know Java, you know how to write Tellurium tests.

=== Q19: How to contribute to Tellurium ? ===
Users are really welcome to contribute to Tellurium in the following
ways:

  # Use Tellurium and report bugs
  # Contribute fix to Tellurium
  # Contribute your Tellurium examples, which all users can run
  # Help with documents
  # Participate discussions in Tellurium user group
  # Introduce Tellurium to other users
  # Bring in new ideas and code samples
  # Become project member

Since Tellurium just became open source for over one month, we really
welcome contributors from different ways.

Our project team is open for new members and is expecting for new
members. We will use the typical open source way to recruit new
members, i.e, the user should first actively work on and contribute to
Tellurium and then we will vote if we accept the user as a member. If
most existing members agree, then the user will become a project
member.

In the meantime, we have an idea to use Tellurium project web site as
an example to implement all Tellurium tests as a reference
implementation for other users. You are welcome to write Tellurium
test code for Tellurium web site as follows:

  # Regular Tellurium test cases using TelluriumJavaTestCase
  # Data driven Tellurium tests using TelluriumDataDrivenTest
  # Pure Dsl files

If you like to contribute on this, we will add your code to our
examples. 

=== Q20: Why you change the project name from AOST to Tellurium ? ===
AOST is used as the project prototype name and Tellurium is the official project name. Tellurium means a lot of for us. First, it means the project is full functional and no long a prototype. Second, the project becomes a team project. Third, the project is targeting Automated testing, not just Selenium test. 

=== Q21: What is data driven test? ===
Data driven test means the testing flow is specified by the input data file and the test framework works as a driving engine to read the input data, do data bind, choose the test specified in the input file, run the test, and compare the expected results with the actual results. This is a total new way of writing tests.

=== Q22: How Tellurium does data driven test? ===
Tellurium provides an expressive way for you to describe the input file formats starting with "fs.FieldSet", define test using "defineTest". Bind your variables to the field you defined in a field set, i.e., the format of a line of data, using "bind", and use "compareResult" to compare the actual result with the expected one. For input file, Tellurium supports pipe format file. You can use "loadData" to read the input data from a file. You can also use "useData" to use a String defined in your test script as the input data. 

=== Q23: What are the usages of TelluriumDataDrivenModule and TelluriumDataDrivenTest ===
TelluriumDataDrivenModule is inherited from DslContext and you should define Ui modules, FieldSets, tests there, but not the testing flow. TelluriumDataDrivenTest is the actual testing class and it can read multiple test modules using the "includeModule" command and then use "step", "stepOver", and "stepToEnd" to control the testing flow. Please see the introduction wiki page for more details.
 
=== Q24: How do I configure Tellurium framework? ===
Tellurium provide a configure file "TelluriumConfig.groovy" and you should put this file in the path you run the tests. In this file, you can change the settings for Tellurium, for example, what port the embedded Selenium server will use, what browser you want to run Tellurium tests, and what is the output format of your data driven tests. 

=== Q25: Firefox version 3.0.1 does not work properly and hang during running a testcase ===
This is a known Selenium issue. A work-around is to install the 2.0.16 firefox version or change browser type to use iehta. You can make this change in TelluriumConfig.groovy file located at the Tellirium root project folder.
