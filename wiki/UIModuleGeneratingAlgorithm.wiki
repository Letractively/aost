The [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/TrUMP Tellurium UI Module Plugin] (Trump) automatically generates UI modules for users. The workflow of Trump is shown as follows:

You may wonder in step 2, how the UI module is generated. The main idea behind this is to get the full xpath for each UI element that a user selects. Then, construct the UI module based on the xpaths. 

The core algorithm is a similar to the one to build a prefix tree. The data structure of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie prefix tree, or Trie in short] can be illustrated by the following Figure, which representing a dictionary with prefix chains.
