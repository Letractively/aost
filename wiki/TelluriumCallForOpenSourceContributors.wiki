= What is Tellurium =

[http://code.google.com/p/aost/ The Tellurium Automated Testing Framework] (Tellurium) is an automated testing framework for web applications. Tellurium grew up from [http://seleniumhq.org/ the Selenium framework], but with a different testing concept. Starting from Tellurium 0.7.0, Tellurium added Tellurium Engine to replace the Selenium Core to better support Tellurium. 

== Why Tellurium is Novel ==

For most existing web testing frameworks like Selenium, they mainly focus on individual UI elements as follows.

For example:

{{{
   selenium.click("//div[3]/input[@value='Create']");
}}}

For Tellurium, we treated the whole UI elements as a widget and we call it a UI module.

We define the UI module as follows.

{{{
    ui.Form(uid: "Form", clocator: [tag: "form"]){
        Div(uid: "User", clocator: [:]){
            Selector(uid: "Sex", clocator: [:])
            InputBox(uid: "Input", clocator: [tag: "input", type: "text", name: "j_username"])
        }
        Container(uid: "Finish", clocator: [tag: "tr"]){
            SubmitButton(uid: "Submit", clocator: [tag: "input", type: "submit", value: "Login", name: "submit"])
        }
    }
}}}

== Advantages ==

There are couple advantages to describe the UI elements as a UI module.

=== Expressive ===

_Expressive_ is obvious. For example, you can see clearly what the UI you are testing against. For the test code, you have DSL stype test code such as:


{{{
   type "Form.User.Input", "John Fang"
}}}

=== Robust to Changes ===

Test robust is always a big issue for Selenium. To solve this problem is one of the main motivations that Tellurium was created for. Tellurium uses UI attributes to describe UI instead of fixed locators. If we change the attributes, new runtime locators will be generated by the framework so that Tellurium can self-adapt to UI changes to some degree. [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/SantaUiModuleGroupLocatingAlgorithm the Santa algorithm] in Tellurium new engine further improve the test robust by using UI partial matching.

=== Represent Dynamic Web Content Easily ===

The [http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/UserGuide070TelluriumBasics#UI_Templates Tellurium UI templates] are used to represent dynamic web content very easily. For example, [http://code.google.com/p/aost/issues/list Tellurium issue search result widget] can be easily represented as follows.

{{{
    ui.Table(uid: "issueResult", clocator: [id: "resultstable", class: "results"], group: "true") {
      //Define the header elements
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as ID", clocator: [text: "*ID"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Type", clocator: [text: "*Type"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Status", clocator: [text: "*Status"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Priority", clocator: [text: "*Priority"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Milestone", clocator: [text: "*Milestone"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Owner", clocator: [text: "*Owner"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Summary", clocator: [text: "*Summary + Labels"])
      UrlLink(uid: "{header: any} as Extra", clocator: [text: "*..."])

      //Define table body elements
      //Column "Extra" are TextBoxs
      TextBox(uid: "{row: all, column -> Extra}", clocator: [:])
      //For the rest, they are UrlLinks
      UrlLink(uid: "{row: all, column: all}", clocator: [:])
    }
}}}

=== Easy to Maintain ===

Tellurium emphasizes the decoupling of UI from test code. The structured test code makes Tellurium easier to maintain and refactor.
