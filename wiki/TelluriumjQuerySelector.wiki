= Introduction =

Start from version 0.6.0, Tellurium adds support for jQuery selector to address the problem that xpath is way too slow in IE web browser. 

Tellurium automatically builds runtime xpath or jQuery selector based on a flag _exploreJQuerySelector_ in DslContext, which is false by default. To use jQuery selector, you should call 

{{{
useJQuerySelector()
}}}

and use

{{{
disableJQuerySelector()
}}}

to go back to XPath as shown in the following diagram.

Be aware that jQuery selector only works for composite locator, i.e., _clocator_. If you have base locator, which is xpath, then the jQuery selector will not work for you.
