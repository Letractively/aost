The Tellurium Automated Testing Framework (Tellurium), formally known as AOST, is a test framework built on top of the Selenium test framework and it abstracts
UI components to Java objects and does object to locator mapping (OLM) automatically at run time so that you can define UI objects simply by their attributes
and write your selenium tests just like writing Java tests. Since the framework constructs the actual locator automatically at run-time and it uses the Group
Locating Concept (GLC) to exploit information inside a collection of UI components to help finding their locators, Tellurium is more robust, flexible, modularized,
easier to maintain and refactor compared with the locator-based Selenium test framework.

We created the Dojo widget project as an extension for the Tellurium Core framework so that we can define Dojo widgets and then use
them directly in test classes simply by including tellurium dojo jar file. Please check the following wiki page for more details

Your feedback and comments are very important to us. Please post your comments and suggestions on Tellurium user group or write directly to us.

Thanks.
