This project is created by Tellurium Maven archetype, tellurium-testng-archetype.
Tellurium provides two Maven archetypes, i.e., tellurium-junit-archetype and
tellurium-testng-archetype for Tellurium JUnit test and Tellurium TestNG test,
respectively.

To create a new Tellurium JUnit test project, use the maven command

mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=your_group_id -DartifactId=your_artifact_id
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=tellurium-junit-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=org.telluriumsource
    -DarchetypeVersion=0.7.0-SNAPSHOT

And for a new Tellurium TestNG test project, use

mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=your_group_id -DartifactId=your_artifact_id
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=tellurium-testng-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=org.telluriumsource
    -DarchetypeVersion=0.7.0-SNAPSHOT

Before this, you must add Tellurium Maven repository into your_home/.m2/settings.xml

To create a new UI module, please use Tellurium Firefox plugin (TrUMP), which can be download
from Tellurium project site at

http://code.google.com/p/aost/downloads/list

Choose the Firefox 2 or Firefox 3 version depending on your Firefox version. Or you can download
the Firefox 3 version directly from Firefox addons site at

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11035

Once you install it and restart Firefox, you are ready to record your UI modules by simply clicking
on the UI elements on the web and then click the "generate" button. You may like to customize your
UI a bit by clicking the "Customize" button. More detailed TrUMP introductions can be found at

http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/TrUMP

and

http://code.google.com/p/aost/wiki/HowTrUMPWorks

Then, create a new Tellurium test case by extending TelluriumJavaTestCase or TelluriumTestNGTestCase.

Run Tellurium tests from command line,

mvn test

If you have any problems, please post to Tellurium user group at
