The Tellurium Automated Testing Framework (Tellurium), formally known as AOST, is a test framework built on top of the Selenium test framework and it abstracts
UI components to Java objects and does object to locator mapping (OLM) automatically at run time so that you can define UI objects simply by their attributes
and write your selenium tests just like writing Java tests. Since the framework constructs the actual locator automatically at run-time and it uses the Group
Locating Concept (GLC) to exploit information inside a collection of UI components to help finding their locators, Tellurium is more robust, flexible, modularized,
easier to maintain and refactor compared with the locator-based Selenium test framework.

The Tellurium framework defines a new Domain Specific Language (DSL) for object-oriented Selenium testing. You can even write your selenium tests in pure DSL format.
Then run the DSL script from command line using script rundsl.sh for Unix/Linux, or rundsl.bat for Windows.

Data Driven Test is another feature of Tellurium. You can define data format in an expressive way. In you data file, you can specify which test you want to run,
the input parameters, and expected results. Tellurium automatically binds the input data to variables defined in your test script and run the tests you specified
in the input file. The test results will be recorded by a test listener and output in different formats, for example, an XML file.

The Tellurium framework is basically written in Groovy, but the test cases can be written in Java and you do not need to know Groovy before you use it. Detailed
introudction, Frequent Asked Questions, and illustrative examples are provided.

Your feedback and comments are very important to us. Please post your comments and suggestions on Tellurium user group or write directly to us.

Thanks.
