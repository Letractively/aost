The workflow is shown as above:
  # User acts on the web and Trump records the events
  # The events are stored as commands with fields such as name, value, and reference id
  # In the meanwhile, the dom node and its reference id are pushed into a list
  # User select on the web and Trump also records the events 
  # The event does not have a command associated with it and is only pushed to the DOM list
  # An inner tree is built based on the dom list
  # The UI module is generated from the inner tree
  # At the same time, a reference id to UID map is created
  # The UI modules are put into the top of output script file
  # The reference ids in the command list are replaced with their UIDs
  # The updated command list is turned into Tellurium DSL script
