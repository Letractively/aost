The Tellurium Automated Testing Framework (Tellurium) is a UI module-based web automated testing framework. The UI module is a
collection of UI elements you group together. Usually, the UI module represents a composite UI object in the format of nested
basic UI elements. The UI module makes it possible to build UI elements' locators at run time. The framework does object to
locator mapping (OLM) automatically at run time so that you can define UI objects simply by their attributes and write your
Tellurium tests just like writing JUnit or TestNG tests. Furthermore, Tellurium uses the Group Locating Concept (GLC) to
exploit information inside a collection of UI components to help finding their locators, Tellurium is more robust, flexible,
and reusable compared with the Selenium testing framework.

We created the extJS widget project as an extension for the Tellurium Core framework so that we can define extJS widgets and then use
them directly in test classes simply by including tellurium extjs jar file. Please check the following wiki page for more details

Your feedback and comments are very important to us. Please post your comments and suggestions on Tellurium user group or write directly to us.

Thanks.
