== Ui Objects ==

Tellurium provides a set of predefined Ui objects, which users can use directly. Here we describe them one by one in details.

=== Basic Ui Object ===

The basic Ui object is the base class for all Ui objects and it includes the following attributes:

  # uid: Ui object's identifier
  # namespace: for future extension
  # locator: the locator of the UI object, could be a base locator or a composite locator

and the base Ui object also provides the following methods:

  * boolean isElementPresent()
  * boolean isVisible()
  * boolean isDisabled()
  * waitForElementPresent(int timeout), where the time unit is ms.
  * waitForElementPresent(int timeout, int step)
  * String getText()
  * getAttribute(String attribute)
