Tellurium UI Model Plugin (TrUMP) is the Firefox plugin to automatically create UI modules for users. 

== Install TrUMP IDE ==

Go to the Tellurium project download page and download the TrUMP xpi file as shown in the Figure,

Then, open the xpi file with Firefox,

== Setup TrUMP From Project Source==

Sometime, you may want to work on TrUMP source. To do this, check out the firefox-plugin folder in tools/firefox-plugin.

Lets say you have checked it into C:\Project\firefox-plugin

First you’ll need to copy the file trump@aost.net inside the extensions-file folder to your firefox profile. 

Profiles for firefox are located in 
C:\Documents and Settings\$user\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\
For Windows OS

For linux,  the firefox user profile lives in

~/.mozilla/firefox/ 

Lets say you want to copy it to user1 profile

Open the user1 profile. Copy the trump@aost.net file to the extensions folder

C:\Documents and Settings\$user\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\user1\extensions

Edit the trump@aost.net file by opening it in a text editor. This file will contain the path to our trump plugin folder, which is C:\Project\firefox-plugin\trump\. Don’t forget the \ after the trump. Save and close the file.

We are done setting up the plugin.

After that, open the firefox with the profile “user1”. You are ready to use TrUMP IDE

== Build TrUMP From Source ==

Check out TrUMP source code from Tellurium trunk/tools/firefox-plugin.

Then run the following ant tasks,
{{{
ant clean
ant dist
}}}

The generated .xpi file is under the /dist directory

== Use TrUMP ==

In Firefox, select "Tools" > "TrUMP IDE"

http://tellurium-users.googlegroups.com/web/trump010e.png?gsc=jTelIRYAAAC0nhYDa9gni8Uq6-kI4oX7g-kXU5InE09W2o0GCSVgCQ

You will see the TrUMP IDE as follows,

http://tellurium-users.googlegroups.com/web/TrUMPIDE0.1.0.png

The "Record" button is on by default, you can click on "Stop" to stop recording. Now, you can start to use the TrUMP IDE to record whatever UI elements you click on the WEB. For example, you can open Tellurium Download page and click on the search elements and the three links,

http://tellurium-users.googlegroups.com/web/TrUMPRecord.png

The blue color indicates selected element, you can click on the selected element again to un-select it.

Then, you can click on the "Generate" button to create the Tellurium UI Module and you will be automatically directed to the "Source" window,

http://tellurium-users.googlegroups.com/web/TrUMPGenerate.png?gsc=8bpDhBYAAADelCD9Y452tE9McTfxJEayg-kXU5InE09W2o0GCSVgCQ

After that, you can click on the "Customize" button to change the UI module such as UIDs, group locating option, and attributes you selected for the UI module.

http://tellurium-users.googlegroups.com/web/TrUMPCustomize.png?gda=OfrPCkQAAACXZPxEX7Ki-M5C2JpeBoXXTJUqAjHYSxXv6NWi-vE8ybjpUZQJGBKU2NRrn2eBK8FV6u9SiETdg0Q2ffAyHU-dzc4BZkLnSFWX59nr5BxGqA&gsc=8bpDhBYAAADelCD9Y452tE9McTfxJEayg-kXU5InE09W2o0GCSVgCQ

You can see there is one red "X" mark, which indicates that UI element's XPath is not unique, you could select group, or add more attributes to the UI element. You will see
the new customized UI as follows, 

http://tellurium-users.googlegroups.com/web/TrUMPCustomized.png?gda=eLPBKkUAAACXZPxEX7Ki-M5C2JpeBoXXTJUqAjHYSxXv6NWi-vE8yWpSkAEfxrsCm-JxAmInjVlzlqnWZQD3y6jZqCMfSFQ6Gu1iLHeqhw4ZZRj3RjJ_-A&gsc=8bpDhBYAAADelCD9Y452tE9McTfxJEayg-kXU5InE09W2o0GCSVgCQ

Note that the red "X" mark is removed because we turn on the group locating and the element's xpath is unique now. In the meanwhile, the UI module in the source tab will be automated updated.

At this point, you export the UI module to a groovy file.

Open up the groovy file, you will see the file as follows,

{{{
package tellurium.ui

import org.tellurium.dsl.DslContext

/**
 *  This UI module file is automatically generated by TrUMP 0.1.0.
 * 
*/

class NewUiModule extends DslContext{

	public void defineUi() {
		ui.Container(uid: "Tellurium", clocator: [tag: "body", class: "t2"]){
		   	Form(uid: "Form", clocator: [tag: "form", method: "get", action: "list"], group: "true"){
		   		Selector(uid: "DownloadType", clocator: [tag: "select", name: "can", id: "can"])
		   		InputBox(uid: "SearchBox", clocator: [tag: "input", type: "text", name: "q", id: "q"])
		   		SubmitButton(uid: "Search", clocator: [tag: "input", type: "submit", value: "Search"])
		   	}
		   	Container(uid: "Title", clocator: [tag: "table", id: "mt"]){
		   		UrlLink(uid: "Issues", clocator: [tag: "a", text: "Issues"], respond: ["click"])
		   		UrlLink(uid: "Wiki", clocator: [tag: "a", text: "Wiki"], respond: ["click"])
		   		UrlLink(uid: "Downloads", clocator: [tag: "a", text: "Downloads"], respond: ["click"])
		   	}
		   }
	}

	//Add your methods here

}

}}}
