The framework was written in Java and later on, couple colleagues from other teams tried to use my framework, but it was quite difficult to use because it lacks of expressiveness. Recently, I refactor my framework using Groovy to make it much easier to use and add a lot of functionalities which are difficult to implement without the dynamic nature of Groovy. I make it open source so that more people can use it and I can improve it with your suggestions and comments.
