#summary How to obtain and use Tellurium via Maven.

= Introduction =

Tellurium has converted its project structure to use Maven. This document will explain the steps necessary to retrieve the Maven artifacts.

= Prerequisites =

You will need to be running Maven version 2.0.9, downloadable from http://maven.apache.org/download.html.

= settings.xml =

Here is a sample settings.xml that will allow you to automatically include Tellurium artifacts in your Maven project. This should go in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file:

{{{
<settings>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
            </activation>
            <repositories>
                 <repository>  
                    <id>kungfuters-public-snapshots-repo</id>
                    <name>Kungfuters.org Public Snapshot Repository</name>
                    <releases>          
                        <enabled>false</enabled>
                    </releases>         
                    <snapshots>         
                        <enabled>true</enabled> 
                    </snapshots>        
                    <url>http://kungfuters.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
                </repository>   
                <repository>    
                    <id>kungfuters-public-releases-repo</id>
                    <name>Kungfuters.org Public Releases Repository</name>
                    <releases>          
                        <enabled>true</enabled> 
                    </releases>         
                    <snapshots>         
                        <enabled>false</enabled>
                    </snapshots>        
                    <url>http://kungfuters.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases</url>
                </repository>   
            </repositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>
}}}

= Dependency =

To include Tellurium as a dependency in your project, add the following to your pom.xml:

{{{
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>tellurium</groupId>
      <artifactId>tellurium</artifactId>
      <version>0.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
}}}

= Build information =

To find regular build information updates, see http://kungfuters.org/tellurium. There you will find information about the project as well as unit test and coverage reports.

= Subversion Client =
To check out code from google code SVN, you should use the SVN client plugins in IDEs or you can use standalone SVN client tools such as
  * [http://smartsvn.com SmartSVN]: a good cross-platform client that supports Subversion  up to 1.5
  * [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org TortoiseSVN]: a good Windows client that supports Subversion up to 1.5
