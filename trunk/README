The AOST framework is based on Groovy, Java, and Selenium test framework. Because of the
excellent Groovy support from IntelliJ, this project is created using IntelliJ. Ant or Maven
build scripts will be added later.

Currently, the project is only tested for Firefox. Please put Firefox-bin in your
operating system path when you run the tests.

If your test case only include one file, you should use StandaloneAostSeleneseTestCase, but
if you like to create multiple test files and put them in one test suite, you should use
GroupAostSeleneseTestCase. The sample test suite is SampleAostSeleneseTestSuite. These
limitations come from the fact that GroovyTestCase does not support JUnit 4 properly. 

Nested Ui objects and ids are supported now.
