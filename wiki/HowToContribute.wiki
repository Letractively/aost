For very active users in Tellurium user group, we will consider you as Tellurium contributors. We will provide you the open source license for the IntelliJ IDEA. A Tellurium contributor can be nominated by one of Tellurium team members as a new Tellurium team member. Tellurium team members will vote if we accept the contributor as a member. If most existing members agree, then the contributor will become a project member and contribute more to Tellurium.

Our project team is open for new members and is expecting new members. We will recruit new members from Tellurium contributors.
