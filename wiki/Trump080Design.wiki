One significant add-on to Trump 0.8.0 is the ability to record user actions and convert them into Tellurium DSL scripts. The following sections cover the design issues for Trump 0.8.0.

The workflow is shown as above:
  # User acts on the web and Trump records the events
  # The events are stored as commands with fields such as name, value, and reference id
  # In the meanwhile, the dom node and its reference id are pushed into a list
  # User select on the web and Trump also records the events 
  # The event does not have a command associated with it and is only pushed to the DOM list
  # An inner tree is built based on the dom list
  # The UI module is generated from the inner tree
  # At the same time, a reference id to UID map is created
  # The UI modules are put into the top of output script file
  # The reference ids in the command list are replaced with their UIDs
  # The updated command list is turned into Tellurium DSL script
